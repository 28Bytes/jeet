- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
- [respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) (makes IE use media queries)
- [placeholder.js](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder) (gives you cross-browser access to placeholder attributes in inputs)
- [boxsizing.htc](https://github.com/Schepp/box-sizing-polyfill) (so Box-Sizing works in IE browsers)
- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (if you'd like, feel free to omit it completely)
- Much more heavily customized stuff to make it all work seamlessly together.


FAQ
=

**Q** Why "Jeet"?

**A** Named after Bruce Lee's, Jeet Kune Do. Mr. Lee combined the best of every martial art into his own fighting style. Jeet Framework does the same by taking the best parts and leaving out the bloat.

**Q** Do you have plans to port this to LESS and SASS?

**A** Yes definitely. In the meantime, try it out on Stylus. Stylus is incredibly underrated.

**Q** Goals for this project?

**A** I'd like to continue fixing bugs as they pop up, and implement as many feature requests as possible until this framework rules them all. Leave suggestions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CorySimmons/jeet/issues).
